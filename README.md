# Rest_Api

In this code exercise, I have tried to form Rest API with only using Python. Since I don't have detailed information about Rest API, I did researchs for this task.
Generally, Flask is used but you want us not to use any third party library. 

I get the text from the user not from a URI. At the end I post the values that I find in functions to the URI.
